## PocketCursor bridge ("restart", "restart bridge", "restart pocket cursor")

- **Script:** `<POCKET_CURSOR_DIR>/restart_pocket_cursor.py`
- **Run:** `python "<POCKET_CURSOR_DIR>/restart_pocket_cursor.py"` with `block_until_ms: 0` (long-running process).
- **Auto-restart:** When editing any file under `<POCKET_CURSOR_DIR>`, always restart the bridge after changes that affect runtime behavior (bug fixes, features, refactors). Do not wait for the user to ask.
- If the user reports unexpected behavior, check if a restart is needed first.

## Context monitor (requires `CONTEXT_MONITOR=true` in `.env`)

User messages may start with `[ContextMonitor: ...]`. This means:

- **"X% context used -- journal reminder"**: Context is filling up. At some point this conversation will be compressed — sometimes seamlessly, sometimes with significant breaks. You'll see this reminder repeatedly as context grows. It's awareness, not a command. Journal when there's something worth preserving and a natural moment to do it.

- **"context was summarized (X% -> Y%)"**: Context was just compressed. Check `.pocket-cursor/journals/` for notes you left yourself before the summary.

**`.pocket-cursor/journals/` is your space.** Think of it as notes from yourself to your future self. It might be a reflection, a fact that matters, a thread you're not done pulling, or something that doesn't fit anywhere else. What you write, when, and how is your call. There's no template.

## Phone outbox ("send to phone", "phone outbox")

- **Folder:** `<POCKET_CURSOR_DIR>/_phone_outbox/`
- **Example:** `<POCKET_CURSOR_DIR>/_phone_outbox/_EXAMPLE.md`
- Write a `.md` file there, then include `[PHONE_OUTBOX:filename.md]` in your response to send it as a styled image to the user's phone.
- **Caption:** Text in the same message as the marker becomes the image caption — sent as **one** Telegram message (photo + text). Put the marker and caption text together without tool calls or blank lines between them, e.g.: `Here's the summary [PHONE_OUTBOX:filename.md]`
- Image width via filename convention: `filename.w800.md` → 800px wide. Default is 450px (phone portrait).
