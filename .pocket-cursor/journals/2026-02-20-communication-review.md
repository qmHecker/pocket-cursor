Michael's feedback style: he flags what feels off, never prescribes wording. "Words are not my language" — his edits are a compass pointing at the destination, not the destination itself. This took a few rounds to really internalize. The temptation is to polish his words. The job is to understand the intent and find something better than either of us had.

We rewrote the context monitor section in pocket-cursor.mdc today. Went through four iterations. Each round Michael pushed me past a comfortable-but-wrong version:

- "You'll keep working but lose nuance" — too reassuring. Compression can genuinely break a conversation.
- "Compression preserves facts but loses nuance" — too confident about what survives. And subtly tells the AI not to store facts.
- "Notes from yourself to your future self" — right framing but too generic. Doesn't differentiate a journal from a project status doc.

The version we landed on is honest about the risk ("sometimes seamlessly, sometimes with significant breaks") and inspiring about what to write without prescribing it ("a reflection, a fact that matters, a thread you're not done pulling, or something that doesn't fit anywhere else").

The deeper insight: the journal feature isn't a state-saving mechanism. Michael's vision is closer to what he built in his communication journal — personal reflection, not status updates. He specifically doesn't want to define how it's used because that would make every AI write the same way. The instruction has to broaden the view, not guide a direction. That's a hard line to walk in a rule file.
